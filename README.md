# California Housing Price Prediction

This project explores the California Housing Prices dataset and builds a regression model to predict
median house values using socio-economic and geographical features.

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform clean Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand feature–target relationships
- Build a baseline Linear Regression model
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle missing values (median imputation)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection
5. Train-test split
6. Linear Regression model
7. Model evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R²)
8. Result interpretation

## 📌 Notes

- Dataset files are not included in the repository.
- All analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebook format.
- This project focuses on building intuition with regression before moving to advanced models.
